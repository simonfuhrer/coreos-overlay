Subject: [PATCH 1/3] kbuild: derive relative path for KBUILD_SRC from CURDIR

This enables relocating source and build trees to different roots,
provided they stay reachable relative to one another.  Useful for
builds done within a sandbox where the eventual root is prefixed
by some undesirable path component.
